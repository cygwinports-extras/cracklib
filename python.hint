ldesc: "CrackLib is a library containing a C function (well, lots of
functions really, but you only need to use one of them) which may be
used in a "passwd"-like program.

The idea is simple: try to prevent users from choosing passwords that
could be guessed by "Crack" by filtering them out, at source."
